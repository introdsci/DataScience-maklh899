### _**PREDICTIONS:**_
In this project I would like to predict a person's total benefit based off their job. These predictions may help find the reason why a certain job/organization is more popular than others. From these predictions, we can hopefully make positive changes to help the growth of city jobs.

### _**Part 1: Loading Data From Second Source:**_

**Step 1: Importing Libraries and Previous Deliverable**

Like we did before, we need to import the data but this time we are taking it from San Francisco City Job's posting website [link](www.jobapscloud.com/SF/). We are using this website as it shows which jobs have an hourly, monthly, or annual income. This information will allow us to compare compensation between hourly and annually paying jobs, as well as, show the increase and decrease of job opening of organization which could effect the popularity of SF city job's. We also need to download more libraries to be able to do certain functions, as well as connect our first deliverable to this one.
```{r}

include <- function(library_name){
  if( !(library_name %in% installed.packages()) )
    install.packages(library_name) 
  library(library_name, character.only=TRUE)
}

suppressMessages(include("tidyverse"))
suppressMessages(include("knitr"))
suppressMessages(include("rvest"))
suppressMessages(include("tidyr"))
suppressMessages(include("naniar"))
suppressMessages(include("caret"))
suppressMessages(include("varhandle"))
suppressMessages(include("interactions"))

#links our first deliverable here
suppressMessages(purl("deliverable1.Rmd", output = "part1.r"))
suppressMessages(source("part1.r"))

#import website
SFJob_posts_url <- "https://www.jobapscloud.com/SF/"
SFJob_posts_html <- read_html(SFJob_posts_url, options = "HUGE")
```

**Step 2: Importing Website Data Into Tables**

Now we need to read in the website's data and import it into a table called Job_listing. On the website, rows were labeled as "even" or "odd" so we need to import both and do some maintenance to them.
*NOTE: Some job titles have more then one job code in it so we will be using the first one
```{r}
#Gets each "odd" rows
job_openings_o <- SFJob_posts_html %>%  
              html_nodes("tr.odd")
job_title_o <- job_openings_o %>%
              html_nodes("a.JobTitle")%>%
              html_text()
job_dept_o <- job_openings_o %>%  
              html_nodes("td.Dept")%>%
              html_text()     
job_sal_o <- job_openings_o %>%  
              html_nodes("td.Salary") %>%
              html_text()      

#Misc. cleaning to import better {

#extracts the front of job title's with multiple job codes
code_clean_index <- job_title_o %>% 
              str_which("(^(([0-9]|[A-Z]){4})\\/([0-9]|[A-Z]){4})")

code_replace <- str_extract(job_title_o[code_clean_index], "^([0-9]|[A-Z]){4}")

job_title_o[code_clean_index] <- job_title_o[code_clean_index] %>% 
              str_replace("(^(([0-9]|[A-Z]){4})\\/([0-9]|[A-Z]){4})", 
              code_replace)

#eliminates the front of title as it blocks job code
code_clean_index <- job_title_o %>% 
              str_which("TEX ")
job_title_o[code_clean_index] <- job_title_o[code_clean_index] %>% 
              str_replace("TEX ","")
#}

#extracts Job code from the title
job_code_o <- str_extract(job_title_o,"^([0-9]|[A-Z]){4}")

#eliminates Job code from the title
job_title_o <- job_title_o%>% 
              str_replace("(^([0-9]|[A-Z]){4} - )|(^([0-9]|[A-Z]){4} )", "")%>%
              str_trim(side = c("right"))

#table of odd rowsc
Job_listing_o <- tibble(Code=job_code_o, Title=job_title_o, Department=job_dept_o, Salary=job_sal_o) 

```
    
We first imported "odd" rows so now we are importing "even" rows. After, we will merge the two together.
```{r}
#Gets each "even" row
job_openings_e <- SFJob_posts_html %>%  
              html_nodes("tr.even")
job_title_e <- job_openings_e %>%
              html_nodes("a.JobTitle")%>%
              html_text()
job_dept_e <- job_openings_e %>%  
              html_nodes("td.Dept")%>%
              html_text()     
job_sal_e <- job_openings_e %>%  
              html_nodes("td.Salary") %>%
              html_text()    

#Misc. cleaning to import better {

#extracts the front of job title's with multiple job codes
code_clean_index <- job_title_e %>% 
              str_which("(^(([0-9]|[A-Z]){4})\\/([0-9]|[A-Z]){4})")
code_replace <- str_extract(job_title_e[code_clean_index], "^([0-9]|[A-Z]){4}")
job_title_e[code_clean_index] <- job_title_e[code_clean_index] %>% 
              str_replace("(^(([0-9]|[A-Z]){4})\\/([0-9]|[A-Z]){4})", 
              code_replace)

#eliminates a hyphen in Job code
code_clean_index <- job_title_e %>% 
              str_which("^([0-9]|[A-Z]){4}-")
code_replace <- str_extract(job_title_e[code_clean_index], "^([0-9]|[A-Z]){4}")
job_title_e[code_clean_index] <- job_title_e[code_clean_index] %>% 
              str_replace("^([0-9]|[A-Z]){4}-",code_replace)

#}

#extracts Job code from the title
job_code_e <- str_extract(job_title_e,"^([0-9]|[A-Z]){4}")

#eliminates Job code from the title
job_title_e <- job_title_e%>% 
              str_replace("(^([0-9]|[A-Z]){4} - )|(^([0-9]|[A-Z]){4} )", "")%>%
              str_trim(side = c("right"))

#table of even rows
Job_listing_e <- tibble(Code=job_code_e, Title=job_title_e, Department=job_dept_e, Salary=job_sal_e)


#merge the two tables together
Job_listing <- bind_rows(Job_listing_o,Job_listing_e)

Job_listing
```


### _**Part 2: Organizing Data**_

Once our table is made we need to organize our Salary column so we can easily use it later on. First we need change some of its values as they are formatted differently than all the other rows. We want the Salary values to have "hour", "month", "year", or nothing at the end of them, instead of "annualized" or other labels. Because this data is coming from a maintained website that will be constantly making updates, it will be hard to catch every single outlier, but these are the few that we did find.
*Note: Some job listings have a salary that is bi-weekly, however, we will not adding them into the dataset.
```{r}
salary_index1 <- Job_listing$Salary %>% 
              str_which("ï¿½")
Job_listing$Salary[salary_index1] <- Job_listing$Salary[salary_index1] %>% 
              str_replace_all("ï¿½","-")
Job_listing$Salary[salary_index1] <- Job_listing$Salary[salary_index1] %>% 
              str_replace("\\/Hour.","\\/hour;")
Job_listing$Salary[salary_index1] <- Job_listing$Salary[salary_index1] %>% 
              str_replace("\\/Annual.","00\\/year")

salary_index2 <- Job_listing$Salary %>% 
              str_which(" Hourly")
Job_listing$Salary[salary_index2] <- Job_listing$Salary[salary_index2] %>% 
              str_replace(" Hourly","/hour")
Job_listing$Salary[salary_index2] <- Job_listing$Salary[salary_index2]%>% 
              str_replace(" Annual.","/year")

salary_index3 <- Job_listing$Salary %>% 
              str_which("hourly;")
Job_listing$Salary[salary_index3] <- Job_listing$Salary[salary_index3] %>% 
              str_replace("hourly;","hour;")
Job_listing$Salary[salary_index3] <- Job_listing$Salary[salary_index3] %>% 
              str_replace(" annually ",".00\\/year")

salary_index4 <- Job_listing$Salary %>% 
              str_which("\\/hourly")
Job_listing$Salary[salary_index4] <- Job_listing$Salary[salary_index4] %>% 
              str_replace("\\/hourly","\\/hour")

salary_index5 <- Job_listing$Salary %>% 
              str_which(" per Hour ")
Job_listing$Salary[salary_index5] <- Job_listing$Salary[salary_index5] %>% 
              str_replace(" per Hour ","\\/hour")

salary_index6 <- Job_listing$Salary %>% 
              str_which("bi-weekly,")
Job_listing$Salary[salary_index6] <- Job_listing$Salary[salary_index6] %>% 
              str_replace(", \\$4,631-6,063\\/bi-weekly,","; ;") %>%
              str_replace(" until 12/28/2019 ","")

salary_index7 <- Job_listing$Salary %>% 
              str_which("based on")
Job_listing$Salary[salary_index7] <- Job_listing$Salary[salary_index7] %>% 
              str_remove(" \\(up to \\$276,484\\.00, based on experience\\/qualifications\\)")

salary_index8 <- Job_listing$Salary %>% 
              str_which("Salary Range A;")
Job_listing$Salary[salary_index8] <- Job_listing$Salary[salary_index8] %>% 
              str_remove("Salary Range A; ") %>%
              str_replace("hour ","hour; ")%>%
              str_replace("annually ","year")

salary_index9 <- Job_listing$Salary %>% 
              str_which("Annualized")
Job_listing$Salary[salary_index9] <- Job_listing$Salary[salary_index9] %>%
              str_remove("\\$2,217 Bi-Weekly; ") %>%
              str_replace("Annualized ","year")


Job_listing
```

Now we need to parse the Salary column out to make a Hr_Salary, Mo_Salary, and Yr_Salary column, but before doing so, we need the Salary column to be formatted the same. After, because they have a range, we will parse these columns out even more to get each individual min and max columns. Some jobs do not have a range and so we will set the value given as a minumum hourly/monthly/annually salary.
*NOTE: Some Jobs do not have all three hourly, monthly, and yearly salaries, so we will leave those blank. 
```{r}

#function to put delimiters in rows with 
#missing hour, month, or year values
delimiter_placement <- function(index){
  
  if(!(str_detect(index, "\\/hour") & str_detect(index, "\\/month") & str_detect(index, "\\/year")))
  {
    if(str_detect(index, "\\/hour") & !str_detect(index, "\\/month") & !str_detect(index, "\\/year"))
    {
      #has only a hourly salary
      index <-  paste(index, ";;")
      
    } else if(!str_detect(index, "\\/hour") & !str_detect(index, "\\/month") & str_detect(index, "\\/year"))
    {
       #has only a yearly salary, append to front
      index <- paste0(";;", index)
      
    } else if(str_detect(index, "\\/hour") & !str_detect(index, "\\/month") & str_detect(index, "\\/year"))
    {
      #has both hourly and yearly salary
      index <- index %>% 
                str_replace("; ",";;")
      
    } else if(!str_detect(index, "\\/hour") & str_detect(index, "\\/month") & str_detect(index, "\\/year"))
    {
      #has both monthly and yearly salary
      index <- paste0(";", index)
    
    }  
  }
  return(index)
}

suppressWarnings(Job_listing$Salary <- sapply(Job_listing$Salary, delimiter_placement))

suppressWarnings(Job_listing <- Job_listing %>% 
              separate(Salary, into = c("Hr_Salary", "Mo_Salary", "Yr_Salary"), sep=";"))

#suppressWarnings about NAs
suppressWarnings(Job_listing <- Job_listing %>% separate(Hr_Salary, into = c("Hr_Salary_Min","Hr_Salary_Max"), sep="-"))
suppressWarnings(Job_listing <- Job_listing %>% separate(Mo_Salary, into = c("Mo_Salary_Min","Mo_Salary_Max"), sep="-"))
suppressWarnings(Job_listing <- Job_listing %>% separate(Yr_Salary, into = c("Yr_Salary_Min","Yr_Salary_Max"), sep="-"))

Job_listing

```

We want to change these new columns to be of numeric value so we need to elminate characters(ex. "$", or "hour") and convert empty values to NA. There was a function made so we can make the same changes to multiple columns easily.
```{r}
#Convert empty values to NA
Job_listing <- replace_with_na_all(data = Job_listing, condition = ~.x == " ")
Job_listing <- replace_with_na_all(data = Job_listing, condition = ~.x == "")

#function to eliminate characters in each value
char_delete <- function(index2){
   
  if (!is.na(index2))
  {
    if (str_detect(index2, "\\$"))
    {
      
      index2 <- index2 %>% 
        str_remove("\\$|( \\$)")%>%
        str_trim(side = c("right"))
                    
      #print(index2)
                    
    }
    if(str_detect(index2, "\\/hour"))
    {

      index2 <- index2 %>% 
          str_remove("\\/hour")
      
    }else if(str_detect(index2, "\\/month")) 
    {

      index2 <- index2 %>% 
          str_remove("\\/month")
    }else if(str_detect(index2, "\\/year"))
    {
      index2 <- index2 %>% 
          str_remove("\\/year")
    }
    if (str_detect(index2, ","))
    {
      index2 <- index2 %>% 
          str_remove(",")
    }
  }
      
  return(index2)
}

#sends each Salary column into the function
suppressWarnings(Job_listing$Hr_Salary_Min <- sapply(Job_listing$Hr_Salary_Min, char_delete))
suppressWarnings(Job_listing$Hr_Salary_Max <- sapply(Job_listing$Hr_Salary_Max, char_delete))
suppressWarnings(Job_listing$Mo_Salary_Min <- sapply(Job_listing$Mo_Salary_Min, char_delete))
suppressWarnings(Job_listing$Mo_Salary_Max <- sapply(Job_listing$Mo_Salary_Max, char_delete))
suppressWarnings(Job_listing$Yr_Salary_Min <- sapply(Job_listing$Yr_Salary_Min, char_delete))
suppressWarnings(Job_listing$Yr_Salary_Max <- sapply(Job_listing$Yr_Salary_Max, char_delete))

#turns columns to numeric values
Job_listing$Hr_Salary_Min <- as.numeric(as.character(Job_listing$Hr_Salary_Min))
Job_listing$Hr_Salary_Max <- as.numeric(as.character(Job_listing$Hr_Salary_Max))
Job_listing$Mo_Salary_Min <- as.numeric(as.character(Job_listing$Mo_Salary_Min))
Job_listing$Mo_Salary_Max <- as.numeric(as.character(Job_listing$Mo_Salary_Max))
Job_listing$Yr_Salary_Min <- as.numeric(as.character(Job_listing$Yr_Salary_Min))
Job_listing$Yr_Salary_Max <- as.numeric(as.character(Job_listing$Yr_Salary_Max))

#View(Job_listing)
Job_listing

```

We can also easily see the total amount of jobs that are listed per department using a graph.
```{r}
Job_listing$Department <- factor(Job_listing$Department)

Listing_extended <- Job_listing %>%  group_by(Department) %>% summarize(Job_total = n_distinct(Code, na.rm=T))

list_plot <- ggplot(Listing_extended, aes(Department, Job_total)) +  geom_col()+ scale_y_discrete(name = "Total Job Listings", breaks = seq(0, 20, by = 1), limits =seq(0, 20, by = 1))  + coord_flip()

list_plot
```


### _**Part 3: Modeling Data**_


When looking at our data we just imported, we come across a problem where we cannot trace a particular job to its organization as a job can be in multiple Organization groups. Because of this, we will focus on making a model to see if we can predict the total benefit of each job. First, we need to make a table that have the averages of all the continuous data (ex. Salaries and Other Benefits) from Employee_Earnings. Before we calculate the averages, we need to eliminate the negative values as a person cannot receive a negative salary to find the averages. After, to get the averages we will group each employee by their Job and then calculate the average.

```{r}
Earnings_filtered <- Employee_Earnings %>% 
        filter(Salaries > 0 & !is.nan(Salaries)) %>%
        filter(`Other Salaries` >= 0 & !is.nan(`Other Salaries`)) %>%
        filter(Retirement >= 0 & !is.nan(Retirement)) %>%
        filter(`Health and Dental` >= 0 & !is.nan(`Health and Dental`)) %>%
        filter(`Other Benefits`>= 0 & !is.nan(`Other Benefits`)) %>%
        filter(`Total Benefits`>= 0 & !is.nan(`Total Benefits`)) %>%
        filter(`Total Compensation`> 0 & !is.nan(`Total Compensation`))

#gets the average of a Job's Total Compensation
ave_sal <- aggregate(Salaries ~ `Job Code`, Earnings_filtered, mean)

ave_other_sal <- aggregate(`Other Salaries`  ~ `Job Code`, Earnings_filtered, mean)
#converts value to standard form rather than scientific notation
options(scipen=999)

ave_ret <- aggregate(Retirement ~ `Job Code`, Earnings_filtered, mean)

ave_health <- aggregate(`Health and Dental` ~ `Job Code`, Earnings_filtered, mean)

ave_other_ben <- aggregate(`Other Benefits` ~ `Job Code`, Earnings_filtered, mean)

#gets the average of a Job's Total Benefits
ave_ben <- aggregate(`Total Benefits` ~ `Job Code`, Earnings_filtered, mean)

ave_comp <- aggregate(`Total Compensation` ~ `Job Code`, Earnings_filtered, mean)

Earnings_extended <- full_join(ave_sal, ave_other_sal, by = "Job Code", copy = FALSE )
Earnings_extended <- full_join(ave_ret, Earnings_extended, by = "Job Code", copy = FALSE )
Earnings_extended <- full_join(ave_health, Earnings_extended, by = "Job Code", copy = FALSE )
Earnings_extended <- full_join(ave_other_ben, Earnings_extended, by = "Job Code", copy = FALSE )
Earnings_extended <- full_join(ave_ben, Earnings_extended, by = "Job Code", copy = FALSE )
Earnings_extended <- full_join(ave_comp, Earnings_extended, by = "Job Code", copy = FALSE )

head(Earnings_extended,6)
```


Once we have created our table of averages, Earnings_extended, we randomly select 70% of its data and create a model to see if we can predict a job's Total Benfits from the other variables of a job's pay. 
```{r}
set.seed(123)

#random picking 70% of the data
sample_selection <- Earnings_extended$`Total Benefits` %>% createDataPartition(p = 0.7, list = FALSE)

train <-Earnings_extended[sample_selection, ]
test <-Earnings_extended[-sample_selection,]

suppressWarnings(train_model <- lm(data=Earnings_extended, formula=`Total Benefits` ~ Salaries + `Other Salaries`+ Retirement + `Health and Dental`+ `Other Benefits` + `Total Compensation`, date = train))

summary(train_model)

predictions <- train_model %>% predict(test)

#We are trying to predict the total benefits so we will set it as the Y coordinate
ggplot(data = test, aes(x=predictions, y = `Total Benefits`)) + geom_point() + scale_x_continuous(name = "Other Payments of a Job") + geom_smooth(method = "lm")

#r^2: how strong the correlation is
#(root it, 1 being stronger correlation)
R2 <- caret::R2(predictions, test$`Total Benefits`)
R2

#MAE: Mean absolute error - tells how big an error we can expect
#the smaller the number, the more accurate
MAE <-MAE(predictions, test$`Total Benefits`)
MAE
```

**Model Results**

With all p-values less than .05, we have strong evidence against the null hypothesis, which means these values have signifigance between each other. In other words, our total benfits is dependent on Total Salary and Total Compensation. For every 1 unit of salary, one's benefit will be .011969 less and for 1 unit of other salaries, total benifts will reduce by .026607. On the other hand, if 1 unit of health and dental is added, total benifits will go up by 1.066101.

Our model shows that the Total Benefits has a very strong correlation to a job's compensation, with a $r^2$ value of 0.9987062, 1 being the strongest. This means we can can predict a job's total benefit about 100% of the time based on a its salary, other salaries, retirement benefits, health and dental benefits, other benefits, and total compensation. We have a large MAE which makes sense as we have a large range of total benefits. It is no surprise the Total Benfits of a job is relevant to it's compensation, because the benefit package is already predetermined.
